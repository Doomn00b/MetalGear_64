# Metal Gear (MSX2)

This repository contains a fork of the fully annotated disassembly of the original Metal Gear game (released by Konami for the [MSX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) in 1987), created by the very talented GuillianSeed - all props to him!


## Why?

The goal is to create a Source Port for the modern AMD64 architecture, that lets todays gamers discover the game in a more convenient way, and to allow the game to more easily be ported to other platforms, as well as allow for extensive modifications.

And... because it's fun - and I got engaged by the idea of learning how low-level languages work, and old game engines.
